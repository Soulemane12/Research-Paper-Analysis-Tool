For instance, unextracted plasma measurements overestimate oxytocin levels and yield unreliable associations. When proper bioanalytically valid methods are used, studies do not find correlations between plasma oxytocin and trust."

(2005) reported that intranasal oxytocin increased trust in humans, as measured by investment in a trust game. However, subsequent replication attempts have failed to reproduce this effect. A meta-analysis of all intranasal oxytocin trust game experiments revealed that the combined effect size was small and not significantly different from zero. This suggests that the original finding may not be robust, and intranasal oxytocin does not significantly influence trust behavior in humans.",
